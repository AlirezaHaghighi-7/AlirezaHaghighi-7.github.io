This post provides a simplified overview of what machine learning is, how it works, and its practical applications. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Key concepts include supervised and unsupervised learning, various algorithms such as decision trees and neural networks, and how these technologies are used in fields like healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving. This post is perfect for anyone looking to get a foundational understanding of this transformative technology.
