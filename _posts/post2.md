This post explores the famous Fibonacci sequence, its mathematical properties, and where it appears in nature. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This sequence can be found in various natural phenomena, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the branching of trees, and the pattern of spirals in shells. The post delves into the mathematical significance of the sequence, its historical origins, and how it has inspired artists and scientists alike. It's a fascinating read for anyone interested in the intersection of math and nature.

Equation: $$ F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), \quad \text{with} \quad F(0) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad F(1) = 1 $$
