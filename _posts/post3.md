This post highlights the value of open-source software, its benefits for collaboration and innovation, and notable projects. Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. This collaborative approach has led to the development of powerful and widely-used tools like the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, and the Python programming language. The post discusses how open-source projects thrive on community contributions, the advantages of using open-source software, such as transparency and flexibility, and ways you can get involved in open source projects. It's an insightful guide for anyone interested in contributing to or benefiting from the open-source ecosystem.

Images can be made zoomable.
Simply add `data-zoomable` to `<img>` tags that you want to make zoomable.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/10.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
